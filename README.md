# Enhancing-Submarine-Safety-with-Supervised-Machine-Learning
In war time, submarines face the critical threat of underwater mines placed by adversaries, posing significant risks of explosion and loss. To mitigate this danger, our project employs a Supervised Machine Learning model to detect and avoid mines in the ocean. By analyzing various environmental and sonar data, the model is trained to identify patterns indicative of mine locations. This proactive detection system aims to enhance the safety of submarine navigation by providing real-time alerts and optimal path adjustments, thereby preventing potential explosions. Our solution not only improves the operational efficiency of submarines but also significantly enhances the safety of naval personnel during missions.
